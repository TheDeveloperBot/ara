When I dream about you, I sleep better. I love our talks, your awkward sense of humor and your soft kisses on the forehead. The fact that you would fight a bear for me is astounding and your ability to make me feel safe and loved takes a weight from my shoulders that I didnâ€™t even know was there. Thank you so much Chris!";
